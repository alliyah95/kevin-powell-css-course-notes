# Notes from Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts Course
## Day 01
- Avoid explicitly setting the `height` of elements.
  - Say you want more whitespace, you can utilize `padding`.
- `em` is relative to the `font-size` of a parent element.
  - It is mostly useful for buttons.
- `rem` is relative to the root `font-size`, or the one set in `html`.
- Use percentages instead of `px` for `width`.
